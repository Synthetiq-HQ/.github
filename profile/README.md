## 🚀 About Synthetiq

**✅ BETA STAGE — NOW IN PUBLIC TESTING ✅**

**Synthetiq** is a collective of developers building software that puts users first — not profits.

We create **offline-first, privacy-focused applications** that don't collect data, don't show ads, and don't require subscriptions. Every app has one purpose, no bloatware, and runs locally on your device for maximum security.

We're inspired by the early internet: free, open, and accessible to everyone.

### 🔨 What We're Building

- **Offline-First Mobile Apps** — Work without internet, no servers required
- **Single-Purpose Tools** — One app, one job, no bloat
- **Privacy-by-Design** — All data stored locally on your device
- **User-Requested Apps** — We build what you need, not what maximizes profit

### 🎯 Our Mission

**We believe users shouldn't be forced to choose between ads and subscriptions for simple utilities.**

At Synthetiq, we build free, open-source applications that respect your privacy and time. We don't collect, track, or sell your data. We don't show ads. We don't charge subscriptions for basic functionality.

**Our Principles:**
- **No Ads, Ever** — Your attention isn't for sale
- **No Subscriptions** — Useful tools should be accessible to everyone
- **No Data Collection** — We can't leak what we don't have
- **Offline-First** — Your apps work without internet connectivity
- **Open Source** — Verify our code, contribute improvements, audit security
- **Local Storage Only** — Data stays on your device, protected by iOS security

If monetization is ever required, we commit to offering the lowest possible prices — but our goal is to keep everything free.

### 🛡️ Why Synthetiq Exists

Today's app ecosystem is broken. Users are bombarded with ads, forced into subscriptions, and have their data harvested — even for simple games and utilities.

We're proving there's a better way. Apps can be powerful, useful, and completely free without exploiting users.

**Our approach:**
- ✅ **Innovation First** — Prototype relentlessly
- ✅ **Quality Code** — Maintainable, transparent, elegant
- ✅ **Open Collaboration** — Shared ideas over ego
- ✅ **Continuous Learning** — Code better every week
- ✅ **Community-Driven** — Build what users actually want

## 📱 Current Projects

### [Synthetiq Invoice App](https://github.com/Synthetiq-HQ/Synthetiq-Invoices)
**Status:** ✅ **Apple Approved — Coming Soon to iOS!**

Our first major release! Generate professional, free invoices on the go. No subscriptions, no hidden fees, no ads — just a simple, powerful tool for freelancers and small businesses.

This approval proves our model works: great apps don't need to exploit users.

### [ImposterGameApp](https://github.com/Synthetiq-HQ/ImposterGameApp)
**Status:** Available as Web App

An open-source offline party game where players deduce who the imposter is through strategic questioning and deduction.

**About App Store Status:**  
Apple rejected this app, stating that "similar apps already exist." However, those existing apps charge money or show ads to users. We've decided not to resubmit because doing so would require compromising our core mission: providing ad-free, subscription-free experiences.

This rejection actually validates what we're fighting against — a system that prioritizes monetization over user experience. We're committed to keeping ImposterGame free and ad-free, even if it means staying outside the App Store.

**Features:**
- ✅ Completely free web app
- 🚫 No in-app purchases
- 🚫 No advertisements  
- 🔒 No user data collected
- 🎮 Fully offline gameplay
