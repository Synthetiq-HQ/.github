## 🚀 About Synthetiq

**🟢 BETA STAGE — NOW IN PUBLIC TESTING 🟢**

**Synthetiq** is a collective of developers building software that puts users first, not profits.

We create **offline-first, privacy-focused applications** that don't collect data, don't show ads, and don't require subscriptions. Every app has one purpose, no bloatware, and runs locally on your device for maximum security.

We're inspired by the early internet: free, open, and accessible to everyone.

## 📱 What We're Building

- **Offline-First Mobile Apps** — Work without internet, no servers required
- **Single-Purpose Tools** — One app, one job, no bloat
- **Privacy-by-Design** — All data stored locally on your device
- **User-Requested Apps** — We build what you need, not what maximizes profit

## 💎 Our Mission

**We believe users shouldn't be forced to choose between ads and subscriptions for simple utilities.**

At Synthetiq, we build free, open-source applications that respect your privacy and time. We don't collect, track, or sell your data. We don't show ads. We don't charge subscriptions for basic functionality.

If monetization is ever required, we commit to offering the lowest possible prices, but our goal is to keep everything free.

## 🌟 Why Synthetiq Exists

Today's app ecosystem is broken. Users are bombarded with ads, forced into subscriptions, and have their data harvested, even for simple games and utilities.

We're proving there's a better way. Apps can be powerful, useful, and completely free without exploiting users.

Our approach:

- 🟢 **Innovation First** — Prototypes relentlessly
- 🟢 **Quality Code** — Maintainable, transparent, elegant
- 🟢 **Open Collaboration** — Shared ideas over ego
- 🟢 **Continuous Learning** — Code better every week
- 🟢 **Community-Driven** — Build what users actually want

## 💰 Our Monetization Philosophy

We're committed to keeping simple utilities free and ad-free. However, we recognize that more complex applications with ongoing infrastructure costs may require sustainable monetization.

Our principles:

- **Ad-Free for Simple Tools** — We don't believe simple utilities should be monetized through ads
- **Subscription-Free Simple Apps** — Basic utilities shouldn't require ongoing payments
- **Transparency First** — If an app needs monetization, we'll explain why
- **User Experience Above All** — We never compromise usability for profit

For complex apps with real costs (servers, APIs, etc.), we may implement ads or subscriptions, but we'll always try our best not to rely on them. Our goal is maximum accessibility with minimal barriers.

## 📂 Current Projects

### Synthetiq Invoice App

**Status: 🍎 Apple Approved — Coming Soon to iOS!**

Our first major release! Generate professional, free invoices on the go. No subscriptions, no hidden fees, no ads. Just a simple, powerful tool for freelancers and small businesses.

This approval proves our model works: great apps don't need to exploit users.

### ImposterGameApp

**Status: Available as Web App**

An open-source online party game where players deduce who the imposter is through strategic questioning and deduction.

**About App Store Status:**

Apple rejected the app, stating that "similar apps already exist." However, those existing apps charge money or show ads to users. We've decided not to resubmit because doing so would require us to compromising our core mission: providing a free, subscription-free experience.

This rejection actually validates what we're fighting against. It's a system that prioritizes monetization over user experience. We're committed to keeping ImposterGame free and ad-free, even if it means staying outside the App Store.

**Features:**
- 🟢 Completely free web app
- 🟣 No in-app purchases
- 🔵 No ads
- 🟠 Play with friends online
